# Axon-model
A dynamic Hodgkinâ€“Huxley Giant squid axon model in Matlab.

This is a project for the 3rd year Subject "Physiology & Biophysics" in the Bioengineering Career in the "Universidad de Entre Rios".
I worked in this project alongside Marcelo Colominas in 2008. He greatly contributed to the coding of the dynamic part of the software with his knowledge of the Matlab programming language.

This is a simplified version of the Hudgkin and Huxley Giant Squid Axon model. It features real time parameter adjustments as well as a static response to any given stimuli within physiologically reasonable limits.
