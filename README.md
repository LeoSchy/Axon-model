# Axon-model
A dynamic Hodgkin–Huxley Giant squid axon model in Matlab. By Leonardo Schymansky and Marcelo Colominas.

This is a project for the 3rd year Subject "Physiology & Biophysics" in the Bioengineering Career in the "Universidad de Entre Rios" in Argentina.

I worked in this project alongside Marcelo Colominas in 2008. He greatly contributed to the coding of the dynamic part of the software with his knowledge of the Matlab programming language.

This is a simplified version of the Hudgkin and Huxley Giant Squid Axon model. It features real time parameter adjustments as well as a static response to any given stimuli within physiologically reasonable limits.

How to run the software
-----------------------

1. Include every file in the same workspace.
2. Compile menu.m
3. The UI should be pretty self explanatory.
